# Tweet Classification: Using Naive Bayes Law and bag of word assumption, we create a Classification model
# and train it using the training data and predict the city a tweet belongs to.

# Design Decisions:
# We are using Multinomial Naive Bayes Classification wherein we create a multinomial distribution of words for
# each city present in the training data and predict the city to which the tweets from the testing data belong to.
# Firstly, we are pre-processing the training data as well as the test data by removing the speical characters, extra spaces
# and carriage return usning regex. We have also removed some of the english stop words and converted all the textual data to lower case.
# Secondly, we are considering all the tokens present in the training data after pre-processing to create a multinomial
# distribution for each city. When we encounter a word not present in a city we punish(multiply by a pseudo count) that city
# by a factor.
# We use Naive bayes law: P(Posterior) = P(Likelihood)*P(Prior) to find how likely it is that a tweet belongs to a particular city
# City with the maximum P(Posterior) value for a tweet will be classified as the city that tweet belong to.
# Here we are ignoring the denominator of the Bayes law because it will be constant for all cities.

# Exprerimentation:
# Initially we tried using bernoulli smoothing so that we don't get a zero probability while calcuating the likelihood matrix(in our
# case a dictionary) by considering a word vector of all the distinct words present in the training data which gave us an accuracy of
# 58.6%. In the quest of improving accuracy as well as reducing the overhead of calculating probabilities of all the words present in the
# training data for each city, we decided to use a pseudo count to punish a city if it doesn't contain a word present in a tweet while
# calculating the posterior probability. By experimenting with different constants we found out that we were getting maximum accuracy at
# pseudo count value 10^-6. Thus we hardcoded this value. Although the accuracy of our model may go down as the size of the training data
# increases. In such case we have to use some other pseudo count value which changes dynamically (eg: 1/total_word_count_in_training_data)
# this might keep our accuracy approximately constant.
