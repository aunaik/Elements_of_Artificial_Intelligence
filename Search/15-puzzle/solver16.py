# The 15-puzzle problem: Given any 4X4 board configuration, the goal state should be reached by sliding one, two or three tiles
# if it is reachable from the initial state.

#Problem abstraction
# State: A state consist of a list of total cost[f(x)], heuristic value [h(x)], cost of path till current state [g(x)],
#        path from initial state to current state and the puzzle board.
# Set of states (S): Set of 4X4 boards wherein 1-15 numbers and 0 arranged are arbitarily.
#                    Where only those boards which can lead to goal state are considered
#                    Therefore, n(s)= 16!/2
# Initial state (I): Any board configuration having 1-15,0 numbers arranged on it.
# Successor function: Successor function generally returns a list of six successors for the given state of board by sliding one,two or three
#                     tiles vertically or horizontally.
# Goal state (G): Here, the goal state is 1-15,0 numbers arranged in order on 4X4 board.
# Cost function: Assuming the cost of moving from one state to another state as 1(Uniform cost function).
#                i.e. C(Sa,Sb)=1, where Sb is successor state of state Sa
#                The path cost is the number of state transitions required to reach goal state from initial state.
# Heuristic Function: Heuristic used here is Linear conflict which considers manhattan distance to move each tile from its current position to
#                     goal state position and divide the total manhattan distance by 3 to make the heuristic function admissible and also penalize
#                     with +2 whenever there is linear conflict between two tiles
#                     Linear conflict: Whenever there are two tiles with value i and j placed in same row or column as goal state
#                                      such that tile with vaule i is placed before tile with value j in current state but is placed
#                                      in opposite order in goal state then we consider it as a linear conflict

# The heuristic used here is both admissible and consistent as it never overestimates at any given state(as we have divided the total manhattan distance
# by 3 to cater sliding of three tiles in a single move) and also the triangular inequality is satisfied at every state.

# Algorithm design facets
# We have used A* algorithm to solve this problem with some variations.
# Firstly, instead of checking for closed state after generation of a successor, the algorithm checks for closed state after popping out a state from priority queue.
# This reduced the number of searches in the closed state list, which inturn reduced the execution time without affecting the optimality of the solution path.
# Secondly, We have removed the state check in the fringe to find out whether the currently generated successor board configuration is already present in the fringe,
# to keep the minimum cost instance of state in fringe. This did not affect the solution optimality, but drastically reduced the execution time as popping a state and
# again ordering the states in fringe takes alot of time to execute.(Credit goes to Piazza discussion, where professor D. Crandall mentioned that sorting heapqueue in
# python is very expensive process).
# The rest of the algorithm is same as A* implementation.

# Difficluties faced and observations
# Initially we used the linear conflict algorithm by referring "https://academiccommons.columbia.edu/catalog/ac:141289". This technical paper explains actual concept
# of linear conflict and proposes an algorithm to the find linear conflict. But after implementing this algorithm, the execution time increased as the linear conflict
# calcuation was taking alot to time. So we tried to find an alternate way to calculate linear conflict which won't take much computation time. We refered a java code to
# understand the logic and have sited it above the linear conflict function in this code.
# We observed that searching the closed states list to find whether a state is closed or not takes more computation time as compared to calculating the heuristic,
# so removing the check for each successor and checking for closed state after priority popping reduces execution time drastically as number of closed state list check
# reduces by a factor of 6.
# Similarly, not checking the fringe for similar state reduces the program exectuion time.
